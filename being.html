    <p>        
      I heard from a friend (who probably heard from someone else) this notion of a human <i>being </i>. I'd like to think of this being as something that transends what we do or think. It's capsulated in time and exists as a compound of everything that I am, have been, and will be.

      "Night advanced. Time was crumbling. In the house of his parents many years back, there had been an hourglass --- of a sudden he saw the fragile and the expressive instrument again, as though it were standing in front of him. Fine and noiseless, the rust-red sand was running through the glass neck; and since it was getting low in the upper half, a speedy little vortex had been formed there."
