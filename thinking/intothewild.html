      Into the Wild documented a young man's journey as a super "rubber" voluntary tramp. With his B.A. degree from Cornell, he was able to elevate the meaning of his experience.</p>
    <p>
      The sense of "fake"ness and materialism repulsed Alex. He wanted to achieve purity by being unbounded by material and ultimately the human world. This observation reminds me of Thoreau's <div class="quote">"Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a table where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious attendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board."</div> 
    </p>
    <p> 
      And similar we hear in Walden, <div class="quote">"No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity to higher principles. If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal,â€”that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality. . . . The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched."</div>

      In a letter Alex wrote to Franz, an old man who lost his family, he challenged the "monotonous security" lifestyle. Albet clich&eacute, was very neatly put:
    <div class="quote"> 
      "So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, Ron, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty."

    <div class="quote">
      "one is moved by their courage, their reckless innocence, and the urgency of their desire"
    </div>
    <p>
      However I was somewhat shaken by his conclusion, <div class="quote">"He (Tolstoy) was right in saying that the only certain happiness in life is to live for others..."</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      This echoed with:<div class="quote">"I have lived through much, and now I think I have found what is needed for happiness. A quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one's neighbor---such is my idea of happiness. And then, on top of all that, you for a mate, and children, perhaps---what more can the heart of a man desire?"</div> I find this rather contradictory to his adventurous spirit at first, then realized that it was just my unconscious insistence on his trampmanship. Maybe it's just a balance. Maybe it's a choice, a choice he didn't get a chance to choose.
