    <h1>traveling | doing</h1>
		<p>Traveling is an end to itself; the pleasure of new experiences outshine almost every single other activity I've encountered. Though it is true that learning and reading are new "experiences" but the wholesomeness of embracing a new area is extremely satisfying. The people I meet while traveling are amazing too; there is some <a href="../thinking/intothewild.html">spirit</a> in those who travel that I find extremely appealing</p>

			<p>India impressed me as an exotic neighbor. Their religious practices, different ethnic appearances, spices, and acclaimed economic development and democracy have made it the top destination. The expectations however got flushed down the drain after my visit. Be warned however that I am only entitled to offer the opinion of a tourist, since my initial five week plan crumbled to a ten day group tour after some unfortunate VISA issues.</p>
			<p>
			When I arrived in Delhi a friend from college and a Harvard alum were kind enough to wait in the airport and accomodate me for a day before my tour starts. I was consciously comparing Delhi to Beijing, and the airport was unfortunately the first item. It was not as clean, spacious, or well organized as Beijing's T3 --- yes I'm not supposed to be so superficial and judge a country by the fanciness of its airports, but through my ten day stay the public facilities were tremendously underwhelming in every single aspect. Maybe they don't collect as much taxes as the Chinese government; maybe the people have the money, but I saw so many poor and unproductive people in the streets, begging at tourist attractions, which is something I don't recall from visiting places in China (or Mexico, if we are to bring in other developing countries, given my limited experiences). </p>
			
			<p>There is a sense of exacerbation on the streets. The wealthy portrayed in the Bollywood movie I saw in Delhi were not only iconic but unsettling. The small villages we passed were more peaceful; maybe I needed to have a more local emersion to feel the true spirit of Delhi and its people.</p>
			<p>
			I bought Nehru's autobiography at a book store as a souvenir for the India I had imagined. The store owner seemed a very educated man and was very vocal about the inability of India's current leadership, compared to the older generations like Gandhi and Nehru. I don't know what makes great people.</p>
			
			<p>I don't want to go to India again in the near future; I just don't feel inspired. Maybe Munbie.</p>
			<p>
			The group I was traveling with was fascinating however. I didn't get to talk too much in-depth with them, but their backgrounds were fun enough to help me realize my need to travel. A Brazilian young woman has been traveling for four years and is still going around, making good friends and seeing the world; a New Yorker just quit her well paying job is on a Asia trip; a guy from a rich family almost got killed from a traffic accident and had a shifted perspective on life and started traveling... It's easy to live in bubbles. Harvard is a thick one, but that's another story.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Bragging right</strong>: took a photo of the Taj Mahal without anyone else in it!</p>
