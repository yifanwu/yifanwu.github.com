              <h4>Algorithms and Data Structures CS124 </h4>
              <p>I gained a new appreciation for sunrise through this course, along with topics in greedy algorithms, dynamic programing, divide and conquer, and linear programming.</p>
              <h4>Algorithms at The Ends of the Wire <a href='http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/CS222/syllabus.html'>CS222</a></h4>
              <p>I took the courses with <a href='http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/'>Prof. Mitzenmacher</a> and learnt to read and talk about computer science research papers. It was a lot of fun and very rewarding.</p>
              <h4>Theory of Computation <a href='http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/cs121/fall12/syllabus.html'>CS121</a></h4>
              <p>Good old turning machines!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="dm" class='class'>
              <h4>Machine Learning CS181</h4>
              <p>We learnt many algorithms to learn about things. It felt ad hoc and somewhat magical. Very useful and intriguing regardless.</p>
              <h4>Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence CS280r</h4>
              <p>Models and algorithms to support improved health care information technology. This class had a humanities touch that I didn't expect. Nicely overlapped with some of my IR knowledge from 222. I had an idea for new way to vidualize search result but it was sadly only half implemented, but the idea is <a href="smart_map_slides.html">smartmap</a>.</p>
              <h4>Econ CS CS186r</h4>
              <p>Information, Prediction, and Collective Intelligence. Eye opening experience about the power of modeling...</p>
            </div>
            <div id='systems' class='class'>
              <h4>Operating Systems <a href='http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~margo/cs161/'>CS161</a></h4>
              <p>This class is a milestone of my CS education in many ways... I <a href='http://blog.yifanwu.net/tagged/cs161'>wrote about it</a> in my blog if you are at all curious. TL;DR: intense design/debugging experience with awesome prof and classmates. GDB and vim became my best friends</p>
              <h4>Data Systems <a href='http://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/classes/cs165-data-systems/materials/syllabus'>CS165</a></h4>
              <p>Learning about basic tradeoffs in designing and implementing modern data system, and looking forward to design a new data system given a data-driven scenario and to built a prototype. More fun with C!</p>
              <h4>Software Engineering CS164</h4>
              <p>I learnt PHP (ewww) and Object C (not that much better)...</p>
            </div>
            <div id='math' class='class'>
              <h4>Graph Theorey: AM 107</h4>
              <p>I'm taking a class with a <a href='http://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/valiant'>Turing Award winner</a>. Not sure if I need to say anything more...</p>
              <h4>Introduction to Probability: Stat 110</h4>
              <p>Took it with <a href='https://twitter.com/stat110'>Joe</a>, one of the most dedicated professors I've had the fortune of learning from.</p>
              <h4>Stochastic Processes: Stat 171</h4>
              <p>Took a lot of random walks (ok, Markov chains, branching processes, Poisson processes, birth and death processes, Brownian motion, martingales, introduction to stochastic integrals, and their applications)</p>
              <h4>Game Theory: Ec1052</h4>
              <p>Took it with some one who lay the foundatins of mechanism design theory, <a href='http://scholar.harvard.edu/maskin'>Prof. Maskin</a>. It was dense but rewarding. It was impressive how much reality came through the lines and lines of math...</p>
              <h4>Linear Algebra and Real Analysis: Math 23a,b</h4>
              <p>Don't remember much besides coming up with proofs over cookies and ice cream... I think it was helpful since I grew closer with the proof mode of thinking.</p>
            </div>
            <div id='other' class='class'>
              <h4>Entrepreneurship and Innovation</h4>
              <p>Fantastic class at HBS where we talked cases.</p>
              <h4>Founder's Journey, MIT</h4>
              <p>Heard lots of good talks by amazing entrepreneurs</p>
              <h4>Cyberspace in Court</h4>
              <p>We analyzed new legal issues born from internet and related techlogies, including copy right, cyber bullying, censorship etc. I used to go to the Berkman Center and CSAIL at MIT a lot for related talks.</p>
              <h4>Atomospheric Chemistry</h4>
              <p>Modeling the atomosphere and understanding climate and pollution phenomena</p>
              <h4>Intro to Psychology</h4>
              <p>It was sort of a science...</p>
              <h4>Kant's Ethical Theory</h4>
              <p>I took it because I ought to learn about moral pholosophy; what would the world be like if no one learnt about it?</p>
              <h4>Comparitive Government</h4>
              <p>Politics is complicated and we are dealing with too many power struggles... Brought me closer to engineering.</p>
              <h4>A class on modernism</h4>
              <p>Covered material from Nietsche, Thomas Mann, the impressists, futurism and so on</p>
