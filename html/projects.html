          True programmers just show code, but the most interesting projects that I've worked on are all in private repos... so I guess I'll just be lame and talk about them in words...
        </p>
        <p>I always wonder about what people talk about so I scraped Harvard FML and I See You Harvard, along with a more rigorous analysis of MIT's media cloud on a couple of serious stories, summaried <a href="data.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>
          If you are still interested here is my <a href="https://github.com/yifanwu">github</a>.

          I also dabble in photography and you could see a highlight of my photos <a href="http://www.behance.net/yifanwu">here</a>, or see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yifanwu/">all of them</a>.
