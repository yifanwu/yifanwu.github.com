    <h1>Thinkings</h1>
    
    <p>
      I'm often skeptical about my thoughts. All the ideas seem to be outdated by whatever happened afterwards. I became too scared to have an opinion, despite being a naturally opinionated person. Instead of resolving this issue, I just developed a somewhat volatile personality, hopping between an extrovert and an introvert, to the annoyance of my friends.</p>
    <p>
      This skepticism, as I have come to realize, could be erosive for the people around me as well since I could never completely buy into an idea. The deep humbleness I feel towards truth is oftentimes translated into arrogance towards other people's ideas. In order to alleviate this personality flaw, I feel I would gain more appreciation for view points and positions if I invested in some myself.</p>
    <p>
      I like to read books that offers not just knowledge but insights and methods. I like to watch movies that develops not just plot but characters. I like to talk to people that brings not only laughter but challenges. </p>
    <p>
      Chances are no one will ever read them, but as a "cure" to my own skeptic personality, I'd like to make a mental commitment to some thoughts and hopefully someone will find them not too boring.</p>
