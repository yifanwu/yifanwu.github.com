# Pre-training

I like Karpathy's lecture series that goes from building pytorch to building chatGPT from scratch. It leaves you with a great foundation https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html.

# Prompting

A lecture in an NLP class about prompting and finetuning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXpJ9EmG3s4. I like this lecture because it provides context into all the different options to massage a model into being helpful.
