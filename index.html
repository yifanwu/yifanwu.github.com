      <p>I'm often skeptical about my thoughts. All the ideas seem to be outdated by whatever happened afterwards. I became too scared to have an opinion, despite being a naturally opinionated person. Instead of resolving this issue, I just developed a somewhat volatile personality, hopping between an extrovert and an introvert, to the annoyance of my friends.</p>
      <p>This skepticism, as I have come to realize, could be erosive for the people around me as well since I could never completely buy into an idea. The deep humbleness I feel towards truth is oftentimes translated into arrogance towards other people's ideas. In order to alleviate this personality flaw, I feel I would gain more appreciation for view points and positions if I invested in some myself.</p>
     <p>I like to read books that offers not just knowledge but insights and methods. I like to watch movies that develops not just plot but characters. I like to talk to people that brings not only laughter but challenges. </p>
     <p>Chances are no one will ever read them, but as a "cure" to my own skeptic personality, I'd like to commit some thoughts and hope that someone will find them not too boring.</p>

			<p>I have learnt so much about the world by reading random books and magazines. First it was reading children's fictions from Zheng Yuan Jie, which were arguably sometimes too worldly for a child.</p>

		<p>Into the Wild documented a young man's journey as a super "rubber" voluntary tramp. With his B.A. degree from Cornell, he was able to elevate the meaning of his experience.</p>
		<p>The sense of "fake"ness and materialism repulsed Alex. He wanted to achieve purity by being unbounded by material and ultimately the human world. This observation reminds me of Thoreau's <div class="quote">"Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a table where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious attendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board."</div> 
		</p>
		<p> And similar we hear in Walden, <div class="quote">"No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity to higher principles. If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal,â€”that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality. . . . The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched."</div>
		</p>
		<p>In a letter Alex wrote to Franz, an old man who lost his family, he challenged the "monotonous security" lifestyle. Albet clich&eacute, was very neatly put:
		<div class="quote">
		"So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, Ron, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty."</div>
		</p>
		<div class="quote">"one is moved by their courage, their reckless innocence, and the urgency of their desire"</div>
		<p>However I was somewhat shaken by his conclusion, <div class="quote">"He (Tolstoy) was right in saying that the only certain happiness in life is to live for others..."</div>
		</p>
		<p>This echoed with:<div class="quote">"I have lived through much, and now I think I have found what is needed for happiness. A quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one's neighbor---such is my idea of happiness. And then, on top of all that, you for a mate, and children, perhaps---what more can the heart of a man desire?"</div> I find this rather contradictory to his adventurous spirit at first, then realized that it was just my unconscious insistence on his trampmanship. Maybe it's just a balance. Maybe it's a choice, a choice he didn't get a chance to choose.

		  <p>Traveling is an end to itself; the pleasure of new experiences outshine almost every single other activity I've encountered. Though it is true that learning and reading are new "experiences" but the wholesomeness of embracing a new area is extremely satisfying. The people I meet while traveling are amazing too; there is some <a href="thinking.html#books#IntoTheWild">spirit</a> in those who travel that I find extremely appealing</p>

			<p>India impressed me as an exotic neighbor. Their religious practices, different ethnic appearances, spices, and acclaimed economic development and democracy have made it the top destination. The expectations however got flushed down the drain after my visit. Be warned however that I am only entitled to offer the opinion of a tourist, since my initial five week plan crumbled to a ten day group tour after some unfortunate VISA issues.</p></br>
			<p>
			When I arrived in Delhi a friend from college and a Harvard alum were kind enough to wait in the airport and accomodate me for a day before my tour starts. I was consciously comparing Delhi to Beijing, and the airport was unfortunately the first item. It was not as clean, spacious, or well organized as Beijing's T3 --- yes I'm not supposed to be so superficial and judge a country by the fanciness of its airports, but through my ten day stay the public facilities were tremendously underwhelming in every single aspect. Maybe they don't collect as much taxes as the Chinese government; maybe the people have the money, but I saw so many poor and unproductive people in the streets, begging at tourist attractions, which is something I don't recall from visiting places in China (or Mexico, if we are to bring in other developing countries, given my limited experiences). </p>
			<br>
			<p>There is a sense of exacerbation on the streets. The wealthy portrayed in the Bollywood movie I saw in Delhi were not only iconic but unsettling. The small villages we passed were more peaceful; maybe I needed to have a more local emersion to feel the true spirit of Delhi and its people.</p></br>
			<p>
			I bought Nehru's autobiography at a book store as a souvenir for the India I had imagined. The store owner seemed a very educated man and was very vocal about the inability of India's current leadership, compared to the older generations like Gandhi and Nehru. I don't know what makes great people.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I don't want to go to India again in the near future; I just don't feel inspired. Maybe Munbie.</p></br>
			<p>
			The group I was traveling with was fascinating however. I didn't get to talk too much in-depth with them, but their backgrounds were fun enough to help me realize my need to travel. A Brazilian young woman has been traveling for four years and is still going around, making good friends and seeing the world; a New Yorker just quit her well paying job is on a Asia trip; a guy from a rich family almost got killed from a traffic accident and had a shifted perspective on life and started traveling... It's easy to live in bubbles. Harvard is a thick one, but that's <a href="harvard.html">another</a> thought.</p>

			If I had only one word to descrive <strong>Puerto Vallarta</strong> it would be, fun. The people there emits a sense of happiness. They were all effortlessly friendly, not for money, nor curtsy, but it's just part of their life.</p>
			</br>
			<p>
			I was actually doing a mini internship for a small NGO startup, <a href="#investours">investors</a>, but it was spring break and there were so many fun things to do --- I tried out surfing, scuba diving, snorkeling, things that I definitely hope to get more into in the future.</p>
			</br>
			<p>
			The (English speaking) people I met there had amazing lives. They might not be changing the world on the grand scheme or making a ton of money, per the usual definition of success, but they were <tilt>living</tilt>. The richness of their presence helped soothe my completely self-inflicted scorching. At that point I realized how much of my past few years was powered by a desire to rebel, to break the mold, to prove a point, to resolve my anger, but not to live, to enjoy and to share. It wasn't sufficient to change my old ways, but I was at least made aware of the alternatives. On the flight back, I felt the burn again, time to run.</p>

			<p><strong>Hong Kong</strong>: I've only gone to Hong Kong four times, all really short and exam oriented (SAT I, SAT II-6, AP-4), but for all I knew it was so compact and everywhere was saturated with human manufacturings. Even the hiking trails were too touched.</p>
			</br>
			<p>A lot of my friends work there (sort of a in between land from China to the States); it's supposed to have good food and night life, both of which are low pri for me, at least right now. I want a life of purer forms...</p>
			</br>
			<p><strong>Taiwan</strong>: it was a high school group "exchange" trip; I was psyched to go and check out this mysterious island that's so close yet so far. I didn't know what to expect, but definitely not flood.</p>			
			</br>
			<p>We passed Hualian when the storm landed and headed down south together. Upon hearing the sad news of many death and injury in Xiaolin, we headed up north in a hurry. I was too ignorant and insensitive of a kid then to capture the change of dynamics of the people, but there seemed to be unity and strength (or what the TV projected at least).</p>
			</br>
			<p>I have no clue about the politics, but as far as I could tell, my parents are as politically opinionated as the average Taiwanese I got to talk to; their values are shared.</p>
			</br>
			<p>I met many cool people on the trip; some deep conversations about spending a period of time living abroad (England and New Zealand) and Buddhism (as state of mind). A semi-pro magician (whom I knew only as someone who didn't do school very well). Traveling inspires great conversations, even for high schoolers.</p>

			<strong>Scotland</strong>: The place seem to breathe; the lushness is not immediately impressive but grows over a matter of just a few hours. It taste like a long lasting tea that needs to be brewed and savored. There are a lot of places that are rainy and lush (like Seattle), but the Scottish careless touch and the tamed cities decorates its lushness.</p>
			</br>
			<p>
				I would love to back to Scotland to explore more than just going on a tour bus and hiking with nearly a hundred, albeit great, people.</p>
			</br>
			<p>
				<strong>London</strong>: London is too dense for me. Opaque with history and well stirred with British black humour. Doesn't help that they have one of the world's most prominent financial districts. </p>
