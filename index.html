    I am excited about helping people ingest large datasets by designing new interactions for
    visualizations. Coming from a databases background, I use ideas from data centric programming to
    inform my thinking about visualization designs. For example, my current project examines the
    relationship between asynchronous/concurrent query execution (well established in the database
    literature) and the design of interactive visualizations. Concurrency has been known to help systems
    and programs run faster, but it has not being applied to designing user interfaces and interactions.
    This is a novel way of thinking about end to end visualization systems performance, turning the
    questions traditionally asked like “how do we make data processing faster”, and “what’s the latency
    that users could stand”, to “how to change UX designs to make visualizations robust against latency
    and asynchrony”.
